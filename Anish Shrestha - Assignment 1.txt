1. Pandas

Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. Its main features include:

a. Data handling tools such as DataFrame and Series that enable efficient management of data.

b. Tools for reading and writing between in-memory data structures and other formats

c. Intelligent handling of missing data with appropriate alignment of data

d. Joining and merging datasets together


2. NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the core scientific computing package in python including:

a. A powerful object with N dimensions array,

b. Random number generation, algebraic operations support,


3. TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework built by Google that provides:

a. A flexible ecosystem which consists of tools, libraries, and community resources.

b. Simplicity when building models with high-level APIs like Keras APIs.

c. Strong machine learning abilities.


4. Keras

Keras is a high-level API for neural networks written in Python, which can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano providing:

a User-friendly interface to build neural networks,

b Support for Convolutional Networks,

c Able to run both CPU and GPU without any notable changes


5. Python’s scikit-learn

Scikits-learn (sklearn) is a machine learning library for Python which provides among others:

a. Simple and effective instruments for data mining and analysis

b. Open source, license free usable in commercial projects
